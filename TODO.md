TODO LIST

Project:
- Create a setup/install script

Design:
- Make set classifier **kwargs as parameters for all algorithms

Algorithms:
- Steady-State Memetic Algorithm (SSMA)
- One-Sided Selection (OSS)
- Learning Vector Quantization 1, 2.1, 3 (LVQ)
- Integrated Concept Prototype Learner 1, 2, 3 e 4 (ICPL)
- Reduction by Space Partioning 1, 2 e 3 (RSP)
- Pairwise Opposite Class Nearest Neighbor (POC-NN)
- Evolutionary Nearest Prototype Classifier (ENPC)
- Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO)
- Adaptive Condensing Algorithm Based on Mixtures Gaussians (MixtGauss)
- Prototype Selection Clonal Selection Algorithm (PSCSA)

Examples:
- Use example/utils.py for dataset generation, imbalance generation, ratio, ...
- Create individual examples for each algorithm.
- Create an imbalanced datasets example.

Any contribution is more than welcome.
